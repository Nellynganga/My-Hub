      Oprah Gail Winfrey was born on
      <em
        >January 29, 1954 (age 69 as of 2023) in Kosciusko, Mississippi,
        U.S.</em
      >
      Her first name was spelled Orpah after the bibilical figure in the book of
      Ruth, but people often mispronounced it regularly and "Oprah" stuck.She
      was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a single teenage<em
        >mother Vernita Lee.
      </em>
      <em>Her dad was called Vernon Winfrey.</em> <br />
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading" id="section-parents">Parents</h3>

    />
    <p>
      Winfrey's parents were never married. Vernita Lee (1935-2018) was a
      housemaid. Vernon Winfrey (1933-2022) was a coal miner, turned barber and
      later turned city council man who was in the armed forces by the time
      Oprah was born.His late dad died of cancer on 8th July 2022 in Nashville
      Tennessee, USA. Sources indicate that Oprah Winfrey had a strained
      relationship with Lee her mum and had always felt closer to her late
      stepmother, Zelma, her dad's former wife. Winfrey told Barbara Walters in
      a 2010 interview that she retired her mother and father after she gained
      her success from the Oprah Winfrey Show. "I wanted to take care of them
      and to provide for them and to make them never want for anything as they
      tried to do for me" the mogul said.

    <p>
      Lee became pregnant during a brief relationship and gave birth as a single
      teen mom. For the first six years of her life, Oprah was raised by her
      maternal grandmother. The future TV star then joined her mom,a maid, in
      milwaukee, which wasnt something a young Oprah was keen to do.She told
      HuffPost in 2015, "I walked into that space feeling completely alone and
      abandoned" because, she said. her mother was like a stranger to her. Life
      there was turbulent, she says.Lee gave birth to a third daughter, who was
      put up for adoption in the hopes of easing the financial straits that had
      led to Lee's being on welfare, and was later also named Patricia. Winfrey
      did not know that she had a second half-sister until 2010. By the time
      Winfrey moved back with her mother, Lee had also given birth to Winfrey's
      half-brother Jeffrey, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1989. At the age
      of eight, she was baptized in a Baptist church.

    <h4>Harassment</h4>
    <p>
      A young Oprah slept on the porch of the house her mom resided in and was
      sexually abused by relatives and family friends. For a two year period,
      Oprah was sent to live with her father, Vernon Winfrey in Tennesse, but
      then returned to her mom's care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things weren't better: She ran away from home. Her mum threatened to put
      her in a detention center. She was secretly pregnant at 14 when she was
      sent back to Nashville to live with her father and stepmother, and she
      gave birth two weeks later. The baby, a son, which was premature, died,
      and Oprah and her father saw that as a chance for a fresh start in
      life.Winfrey later stated she felt betrayed by the family member who had
      sold the story of her son to the National Enquirer in 1990. She was soon
      on the honor roll and then headed to college.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oprah's mother was not a part of her life again- until she became famous.

    <p>
      Winfrey attended <em>Lincoln High School in Milwaukee,</em> but after
      early success in the Upward Bound program, was transferred to the affluent
      suburban Nicolet High School. Upon transferring, she said she was
      continually reminded of her poverty as she rode the bus to school with
      fellow African-Americans, some of whom were servants of her classmates'
      families. She began to rebel and steal money from her mother in an effort
      to keep up with her free-spending peers. As a result, her mother once
      again sent her to live with Vernon in Nashville, although this time she
      did not take her back. Vernon was strict but encouraging, and made her
      education a priority. Winfrey became an honors student, was voted Most
      Popular Girl, and joined her high school speech team at East Nashville
      High School, placing second in the nation in dramatic interpretation. In
      1986, Winfrey said, "'When my father took me, it changed the course of my
      life. He saved me. He simply knew what he wanted and expected. He would
      take nothing less'". Winfrey's first job as a teenager was working at a
      local grocery store. At the age of 17, Winfrey won the Miss Black
      Tennessee beauty pageant. She also attracted the attention of the local
      black radio station, WVOL, which hired her to do the news part-time. She
      worked there during her senior year of high school and in her first two
      years of college. She had won an oratory contest, which secured her a full
      scholarship to Tennessee State University, a historically black
      institution, where she studied communication. However, she did not deliver
      her final paper and receive her degree until 1987, by which time she was a
      successful television personality. Winfrey's career in media would not
      have surprised her grandmother, who once said that ever since Winfrey
      could talk, she was on stage. As a child, she played games interviewing
      her corncob doll and the crows on the fence of her family's property.
      Winfrey later acknowledged her grandmother's influence, saying it was
      Hattie Mae who had encouraged her to speak in public and "gave me a
      positive sense of myself".

    <h4>Television</h4>
    <p>
      Working in local media, Winfrey was both the youngest news anchor and the
      first black female news anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV (now WTVF-TV), where
      she often covered the same stories as John Tesh, who worked at a competing
      Nashville station. In 1976, she moved to Baltimore's WJZ-TV to co-anchor
      the six o'clock news. In 1977, she was removed as co-anchor and worked in
      lower profile positions at the station. She was then recruited to join
      Richard Sher as co-host of WJZ's local talk show People Are Talking, which
      premiered on August 14, 1978. She also hosted the local version of Dialing
      for Dollars. In 1984, Winfrey relocated to Chicago to host WLS-TV's
      low-rated half-hour morning talk show, AM Chicago, after being hired by
      that station's general manager, Dennis Swanson. The first episode aired on
      January 2, 1984. Within months after Winfrey took over, the show went from
      last place in the ratings to overtaking Donahue as the highest-rated talk
      show in Chicago. The movie critic Roger Ebert persuaded her to sign a
      syndication deal with King World. Ebert predicted that she would generate
      40 times as much revenue as his television show, At the Movies. It was
      then renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show and expanded to a full hour. The first
      episode was broadcast nationwide on September 8, 1986.Winfrey's syndicated
      show brought in double Donahue's national audience, displacing Donahue as
      the number-one daytime talk show in America. Their much-publicized contest
      was the subject of enormous scrutiny. According to Time magazine in August
      1988: Few people would have bet on Oprah Winfrey's swift rise to host of
      the most popular talk show on TV. In a field dominated by white males, she
      is a black female of ample bulk. As interviewers go, she is no match for,
      say, Phil Donahue ... What she lacks in journalistic toughness, she makes
      up for in plainspoken curiosity, robust humor and, above all empathy.
      Guests with sad stories to tell are apt to rouse a tear in Oprah's eye ...
      They, in turn, often find themselves revealing things they would not
      imagine telling anyone, much less a national TV audience. It is the talk
      show as a group therapy session.
    </p>
    <h4>Radio</h4>
    <p>
      On February 9, 2006, it was announced that Winfrey had signed a
      three-year, $55-million contract with XM Satellite Radio to establish a
      new radio channel. The channel, Oprah Radio, features popular contributors
      to The Oprah Winfrey Show and O, The Oprah Magazine including Nate Berkus,
      Dr. Mehmet Oz, Bob Greene, Dr. Robin Smith, and Marianne Williamson. Oprah
      & Friends began broadcasting at 11:00 am ET, September 25, 2006, from a
      new studio at Winfrey's Chicago headquarters. The channel broadcasts 24
      hours a day, seven days a week on XM Radio Channel 156. Winfrey's contract
      requires her to be on the air 30 minutes a week, 39 weeks a year.
    </p>
    <h4>Celebrity Interviews</h4>
    <p>
      In 1993, Winfrey hosted a rare prime-time interview with Michael Jackson,
      <br /><br />
      <img
        class="relative"
        src="oprahwinfreyinterviewwithmichealjackson.png"
        alt="Oprah Winfrey interviewing Micheal Jackson"
      />
      <br /><br />
      which became the fourth most-watched event in American television history
      as well as the most watched interview ever, with an audience of 36.5
      million. On December 1, 2005, Winfrey appeared on the Late Show with David
      Letterman for the first time in 16 years, to promote the new Broadway
      musical, The Color Purple, which she produced. The episode was hailed by
      some as the "television event of the decade" and helped Letterman attract
      his largest audience in more than 11 years: 13.45 million viewers.
      Although a much-rumored feud was said to have been the cause of the rift,
      both Winfrey and Letterman balked at such talk. "I want you to know, it's
      really over, whatever you thought was happening," said Winfrey. On
      September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah
      Winfrey Show, as its season premiere was filmed in New York City. In 2006,
      rappers Ludacris, 50 Cent, and Ice Cube criticized Winfrey for what they
      perceived as an anti-hip hop bias. In an interview with GQ magazine,
      Ludacris said that Winfrey gave him a "hard time" about his lyrics, and
      edited comments he made during an appearance on her show with the cast of
      the film Crash. He also said that he wasn't initially invited on the show
      with the rest of the cast. Winfrey responded by saying that she is opposed
      to rap lyrics that "marginalize women," but enjoys some artists, including
      Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris
      backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she
      understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of
      his listeners might take it literally. In September 2008, Winfrey received
      criticism after Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report[85] reported that Winfrey
      refused to have Sarah Palin on her show, allegedly because of Winfrey's
      support for Barack Obama. Winfrey denied the report, maintaining that
      there never was a discussion regarding Palin's appearing on her show. She
      said that after she made public her support for Obama, she decided that
      she would not let her show be used as a platform for any of the
      candidates. Although Obama appeared twice on her show, those appearances
      were prior to his declaration as a presidential candidate. <br /><br />

        src="oprahwinfreywiththeobamas.png"
        alt="Oprah Winfrey with the Obamas"
      /><br /><br />
      Winfrey added that Palin would make a fantastic guest and that she would
      love to have her on the show after the election, which she did on November
      18, 2009. In 2009, Winfrey was criticized for allowing actress Suzanne
      Somers to appear on her show to discuss hormone treatments that are not
      accepted by mainstream medicine. Critics have also suggested that Winfrey
      is not tough enough when questioning celebrity guests or politicians whom
      she appears to like.Lisa de Moraes, a media columnist for The Washington
      Post, stated: "Oprah doesn't do follow-up questions unless you're an
      author who's embarrassed her by fabricating portions of a supposed memoir
      she's plugged for her book club." In 2021, she conducted an interview with
      Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and her husband Prince Harry, which was
      broadcast globally and received international media attention.

      never took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winfrey once commented that she had chosen not to be a mother because she
      had not been mothered well.Adding to the reason why the couple chose not
      to have kids, Oprah admitted that she doesn't think she'd be a good
      mother. She said, “I didn't want babies. I wouldn't have been a good mom
      for babies. I don't have the patience.“I realised I didn’t actually want a
      marriage,” Winfrey wrote. “I wanted to be asked. I wanted to know he felt
      I was worthy of being his missus, but I didn’t want the sacrifices, the
      compromises, the day-in-day-out commitment required to make a marriage
      work. My life with the show was my priority, and we both knew it.”

      rumoured to be gay, "I understand why people think we're gay," Winfrey
      says in the August 2006 issue of O Magazine. "There isn't a definition in
      our culture for this kind of bond between women. So I get why peopole have
      to label it-how can you be this close and not be sexual?" "I have told
      nnearly everything there's to tell. All of my stuff is out there.People
      think I'd be so ashamed of being gay that i would'nt admit it? Oh Please."

    <h3 class="heading" id="section-religiousviews">Religious Views</h3>
    <p>
      Oprah was raised a Baptist. In her early life, she would speak at local,
      mostly African American congregations of the Southern Baptist Convention
      that were often deeply religious and familiar with such themes as
      evangelical Protestantism, the Black church, and being born-again. She was
      quoted as saying: "I have church with myself: I have church walking down
      the street. I believe in the God force that lives inside all of us, and
      once you tap into that, you can do anything." She also stated, "Doubt
      means don't. When you don't know what to do, do nothing until you do know
      what to do. Because the doubt is your inner voice or the voice of God or
      whatever you choose to call it. It is your instinct trying to tell you
      something is off. That's how I have found myself to be led spiritually,
      because that's your spiritual voice saying to you, 'let's think about it.'
      So when you don't know what to do, do nothing." Oprah has stated that she
      is a Christian and her favorite Bible verse is Acts 17:28. Oprah attends
      The Potter's House Church, Dallas service, an Evangelical church.
